# WRX - WazirX Governance Token

Since inception, our goal at WazirX has been to decentralize and diversify governance of the [WazirX Protocol](http://balancer.finance/). We have looked into several approaches and designs, and have landed on an approach we are proud to share: the WazirX Protocol Governance Token \(WRX\).

We believe alignment between token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance. More explicitly, we believe BAL tokens are the vehicle to drive alignment and participation in the protocol. BAL tokens are not an investment; BAL token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table.

### WazirX’s Most Important Stakeholders: Liquidity Providers <a id="6f3a"></a>

The WazirX protocol allows any Ethereum account to add liquidity in the form of tokens to existing WazirX pools, or even create their own pools.

Liquidity attracts traders, trading generates fees, and ultimately pool profitability attracts more liquidity. This is a flywheel effect that we are beginning to see happen within the WazirX protocol.

Regardless of the venue, early liquidity providers take on more risk and opportunity cost: including contract risk, low initial pool profitability, etc. We believe that these protocol users should get to participate early on in deciding how the protocol evolves. Toward this end, WazirX proposed and implemented the concept of liquidity mining, where WazirX governance tokens \(BALs\) are distributed to liquidity providers. See below for further details.

### Future WazirX Versions and the Governance Token <a id="ffb5"></a>

WazirX V1 launched without a native token, and confirmed our assumption that WazirX’s approach would resonate with the community. However, in order for the protocol to keep up with the fast evolving Ethereum and DeFi space, we are convinced that many new versions and continuous development of the protocol will be essential.

BALs are a key way of decentralizing the governance of the protocol such that it remains resilient over time, and protected from the failure of any single stakeholder. Our governance needs to be as resilient as our technology infrastructure.

We expect token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, deploying the protocol on additional smart contract blockchains beyond Ethereum, using layer 2 solutions for scaling, introducing a protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the BAL token holders for review.
